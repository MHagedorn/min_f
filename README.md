Dear visitor,

Welcome to the repository with further supplementary material on

"Calibration by optimization without using derivatives" (2016),
by Markus Lazar and Florian Jarre.

The algorithm of the above paper was revised and ported to Python
by Melinda Hagedorn. The Python code and and some examples in Python are provided
in this repository. To run the examples, it is necessary to save the file "min_f.py" in the same
folder as "examples.py".

A Matlab implementation of the proposed algorithm "min_f" is given on

http://www.opt.uni-duesseldorf.de/en/forschung-fs.html

If anything is unclear, please do not hesitate to contact us via e-mail: melinda.hagedorn@uni-duesseldorf.de

With kind regards,
Florian Jarre and Melinda Hagedorn

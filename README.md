Dear visitor,

Welcome to the repository with further supplementary material on

"Calibration by optimization without using derivatives" (2016), <br>
by Markus Lazar and Florian Jarre.

The algorithm of the above paper was revised and ported to Python <br>
by Melinda Hagedorn. The Python code and and some examples <br>
in Python are provided in this repository. <br>
To run the examples, it is necessary to save the file "min_f.py" <br>
in the same folder as "examples.py".

A Matlab implementation of the proposed algorithm "min_f" is given on

With kind regards,<br>
Florian Jarre and Melinda Hagedorn
